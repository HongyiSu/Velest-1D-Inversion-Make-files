Abstract
According to Natural Resources Canada, South Mt. Meager project, which taken place in this area, is the most advanced geothermal power project in all Canada (Natural Resources Canada, 2017). We mainly focus on studying a background reference model in this study. Passive Seismic Tomography (PST) is the geophysical technique that I applied in this study.
